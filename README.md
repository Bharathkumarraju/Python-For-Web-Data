##Contents
I have added the PDF notes of Chapter 11-13 of the book **Python for Informatics** and the scripts written as part of this certification course. The written scripts deal with Web Scraping at a very basic level using BeautifulSoup, UrlLib and Regular Expressions. Additionally I have added some basics of GeoJSON as well.
